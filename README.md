# gait_calculation
Motion sensor analysis with gait calculations.

In this project, we are interested in identifying a person's motion (whether one is running, walking, or limping). 24 datasets are collected using a mobile sensor application called Physics Toolbox Sensor Suite.


Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn

## How to run:
The results and tables can be found in main.ipynb. The notebook can simply be opened and run through.
