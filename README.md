# gait_calculation
Motion sensor analysis with gait calculations.

In this project, we are interested in identifying a person's motion (whether one is running, walking, or limping). 24 datasets are collected using a mobile sensor application called Physics Toolbox Sensor Suite.

The data was stored by the app in a .csv file format to be processed later. Our data was collected by having the person demonstrate a specific motion for roughly sixty seconds, with the time taken to start and stop the recording added to that total. For comparisons, the data was collected with the phone in three different locations: held in hand, placed in a pocket, and placed at the ankle. A data set is also included that includes real step counts to verify step frequency in a later stage.

== Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn ==

## How to run:
The results and tables can be found in main.ipynb. The notebook can simply be opened and run through.
